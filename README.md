# SelfDrivingCar-using-NEAT-Algorithm


## Overview

This project showcases a car racing simulation using NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). The AI-driven cars learn to navigate a track autonomously by evolving over generations to optimize their performance.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Learning:** Cars are controlled by neural networks that evolve using the NEAT algorithm, improving their driving skills over time.
- **Track Navigation:** The simulation features a custom-designed track where cars start from a specific start line (green checkered area) and learn to avoid obstacles and stay on track.
- **Sensor Visualization:** Each car is equipped with virtual sensors, visualized as lines, to detect track boundaries and make informed driving decisions.
- **Full-Screen Simulation:** The simulation runs in full-screen mode for an immersive experience.
- **Real-Time Evolution:** Watch as the AI cars evolve and improve their navigation skills in real-time.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CHAITANYA2605/SelfDrivingCar-using-NEAT-Algorithm.git
   cd neat-car-simulation
   python main.py



### Summary of Changes:
- **Results Section:** Added a section to showcase the performance metrics of the car during the simulation. It includes placeholders for "Best Fitness Achieved," "Number of Generations," and "Best Genome."

- **Example Results:** Provided example results to give users an idea of what kind of data they can expect from the simulation.

This README now not only explains the project and how to set it up but also offers a way to document and analyze the performance results of the AI as it evolves.



### Instructions:

- Replace `"CHAITANYA2605"` in the GitHub clone URL with your actual GitHub username.
- Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file listing all the necessary Python packages (e.g., `pygame`, `neat-python`).
- If you have a specific license file, link it appropriately.

This README provides a clear overview of the project, instructions for installation, and a brief explanation of how the simulation works.
